# Victus

Our project for the Angelhacks hackathon, Delhi edition.

We finished 2nd, by the way.

Victus is a table booking + in restaurant ordering system for, you guessed it, restaurants.

### Flow

A person with Victus mobile app walks in a restaurant. His table has a QR code. He scans it into the Victus app and he gets the menu card of the restaurant. At the same time, in the restaurant owner's system, the table is shown online. The customer can directly place an order from the app or call a waiter. After having food, he can directly check out through the Victus app.
